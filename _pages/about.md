<font color=LightCoral>I'm looking for self-motivated students working with me on computer vision and medical image analysis for the fall of 2021. For prospective students, please send me an email with your CV and transcript.</font>




**Research Interests**
======
My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and medical image analysis, particularly in shape based object representation and detection, deep learning algorithms under various learning paradigms and their application to medical image analysis.

**Short Bio**
======
Wei Shen is a tenure-track Associate Professor at the Artificial Intelligence Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, since October 2020. Before that, he was an Assistant Research Professor at the Department of Computer Science, [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), worked with [Bloomberg Distinguished Professor Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2007 and in 2012, respectively. In 2012, he joined Shanghai University, served as an Assistant Professor and then an Associate Professor until Oct 2018. He also worked as a research intern with [Prof. Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) at Microsoft Research Asia. He has over 40 peer-reviewed publications in computer vision and machine learning related areas, including IEEE Trans. PAMI, IEEE Trans. Image Processing, NIPS, ICML, ICCV, CVPR, ECCV and MICCAI.
